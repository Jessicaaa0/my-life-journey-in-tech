i haven't always wanted to be in tech, at first i wanted to be a petroleum engineer because my mum wanted me to but that didn't work out so i decided to pick my own path and i chose computer science. computer science is very vass so choosing the one you want to go for was almost hard but eventually i did, people kept telling me things about it, that it was hard but it paid at first that was my motivation but when i researched about it, i saw many opportunites and that eventually brought me to tech. i watched many videos about the introduction to tech even downloaded the app and it helped but i knew i needed more, so i decided to register for physical classes cause i thought it would be helpful and easier and so far it is going great. buttom line, my joruney to tech is just beginning and i know it won't be easy and i still have a long way to go but i'm ready for it. i would've started immediately when i decided but i knew if i wanted to start i needed to start right, i didn't have a laptop so i had to wait for months before beginning and it wasn't easy but i had motivation. i don't have much to say because this is the beginning of journey but i'm excited to know how it eventually ends, the process is going to be long but i trust it.
